# GZGunGodz
GZGunGodz is a GZDoom Engine port of Vlambeer's Gun Godz (https://store.steampowered.com/app/522940/GUN_GODZ/)

# What Is this mod!?
The age old problem of game engines having weird quirks. This is a mod that aims to replicate the original game
as well as possible in the Doom engine, utilizing GZDoom. This allows for better access to the game as a whole
and avoiding any potential issues playing the original or steam release.
